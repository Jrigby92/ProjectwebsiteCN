        The methods, skills and resources required to complete digital projects will obviously vary depending on the project. However, these three categories can be broken down and evaluated to identify and elaborate on their most important elements.

    I will begin by discussing the role of methods in the successful completion of digital projects; Methods are a vehicle used to travel along the common project stages such as:  Product conception, development, build, testing and completion. In the digital industry, project revisions and requirement changes are common. They can arrive at any point within the development or maintenance process. As a result, flexible methods such as Scrum and Kanban have become popular in the digital industry, these methods are notable in their ability to break down a backlog into manageable objectives and execute them efficiently. ‘Scrums’ adoption of other techniques such as ‘ceremonies’ or stand ups aid this process by enhancing communications between and amongst teams. Often allowing different teams to work in parallel. Alternate methods such as waterfall can also be used, but this particular method is less flexible due to its linear step by step approach and therefore less common. It’s easy to see why methods play a vital role in moving through each of the key stages in digital projects. Thus  enabling teams to successfully deliver projects that are in line with client requirements and are completed in a timely manner. 
    
    Secondly, the skills required for the completion of digital projects can be broken down into hard skills and soft skills. Soft skills are mostly people centred and are important in co-ordinating and managing project teams  and objectives. Soft skills include: Leadership Skills, teamwork, communication Skills, problem solving skills, work ethic, flexibility/Adaptability, Interpersonal Skills. It’s likely that the same soft skills are required in most digital projects, although perhaps in varying proportions.

    </div>
    <div id="div2"  ><p  style=" font-size:20px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"> However, the hard skills required from project to project will almost certainly change. The hard skills are knowledge based skills i.e javascript coding abilities, html coding abilities, even legal abilities or market knowledge.  The hard skills required are likely to change with each project as each app, website, or software program etc are likely to use different types of code, need different types of legal information and will be released into different markets. It’s easy to see how these skill sets integrate to successfully execute project objectives, that are technically sound and are delivered on time. It should also be clear how methods integrate into and make the most of any teams skillsets, creating a synergistic effect.
    
        The final key component in this trilogy would be the resources required to complete digital projects. The resources required will for the most part be similar to those of any business project, namely: Money, man hours and equipment. Although it’s likely that Digital projects will differ in the types of equipment required. As, computer or technical hardware and software will of course play a very leading role in any digital project. It’s also worth noting that most of the software used by digital business will be designed to aid either soft skills or hard skills within teams / companies. For example, Trello, Slack or Zoom are all pieces of software that will aid in communications, management, leadership, teamwork and flexibility / adaptability; which are all soft skills. Conversely, Visual studio code, Microsoft azure, Sublime, Selenium are all types of software which will aid some of the hard skills involved with completing digital projects.
