    Some of the major factors involved in the success of digital projects were outlined in section 1.2 (methods, skills, resources). Conversely, these factors will likely play a major role in the failure of digital projects if handled incorrectly.

<p  style="font-size:30px;" class="turnblack">In detail</p>
  <p  style=" font-size:20px;" class="turnblack"> To give some examples: <br> In regards to resources, a project could be insufficiently funded or bad management could result in a fast depletion of finances. Or perhaps a project leader won’t utilise the proper software or hardware available, preventing a team or company from staying competitive. 
<br><br>
    In regards to how a project might fail for skills related reasons: <br> Perhaps a project leader will focus too much on hard skills, and the project teams will suffer from poor management, or task duplications due to lack of communication. Or perhaps there will be a skills gap and vital positions won’t be filled, which could lead to deadline issues as current team members are forced to learn on the job to fill the gaps. It’s also possible that the team is unknowingly ill qualified to carry out a project, they might reach completion only to realise their app or website heavily infringes upon GDPR guidelines. Cyber security issues are also an increasingly significant threat to all businesses, if the team isn’t skilled enough to deal with cyber attacks this could certainly lead to problems, and could prevent a team from completing a project within the monetary, or time related parameters. 
    <br><br>
    Finally, the methods employed by project leaders could be inappropriate for the task at hand. Perhaps the assigned project is to begin the development of an app that brings a new concept to the market and is thus still vulnerable to many design changes during the process. If the team leader chooses a linear method such as waterfall which by default relies on few or zero project changes, the team could be heading towards an organisational meltdown.  </p> <br><br>
