    The legal guidelines and constraints that could be applicable to digital projects are manyfold, but the two legal areas that have most impact on the digital sector are:

    <ol class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;">
    <li>	legal issues related to data collection and processing. I.e. GDPR guidelines.  </li>
    <li>	Copyright infringements. </li>
  </ol> 
  <p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;">
      To provide a clearer example of data related guidelines I have found some information online, listing the 8 basic rights of GDPR which all business and organisations must adhere to : 
    </p>

  <ol class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;">
    <li>	The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested. </li>
      <li>  The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted. </li>
      <li>	The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format. </li>
        <li>The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied. </li>
      <li>	The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.</li>

   <!-- <p> To name but a few..... these uses of IT are mirrored across the world in a wide variety of companies, from international PLC’s to domestic SME’s. There are ever increasing IT based products and services available for businesses to make use of. 
    
    Secondly, I believe the ways in which Tesla uses IT to create opportunities for the world is obvious. For Tesla, it’s rooted in its highly sophisticated product design of electric vehicles. These products will have required various types of IT to create. They also require large amounts and many types of IT to run, in the form of software updates and incremental battery improvements etc. I believe they have created an opportunity for humanity by providing a safe and green alternative to traditional carbon dioxide producing cars. Providing humans with the opportunity to carry on as normal but in a safer and more efficient way.

    <div id="div2"><p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px; ">  Also, to provide a clearer example of the reasons for tightening digital copyright laws I have found some information online: <br><br>

        COPYRIGHT ISSUES IN DIGITAL MEDIA <br><br>
         
        3.1 Software <br>
         Fastest growing industry, the computer software industry has created its own set of copyright 
        issues. Because most of the software programs can be easily copied and recreate perfectly. 
         Also extends possibility loading program onto more  than one computer, which  is not  only 
        infringing but also breaches license agreement that limits use to only one computer. 
         However,  as  tempting  as  this  practice  may  be,  it  constitutes  a  major  act  of  copyright 
        infringement and software piracy. According to Business Software Alliance (BSA) 35% of the 
        world’s software is pirated, where in India its 69%. [2]
