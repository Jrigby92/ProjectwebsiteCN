  <p  style=" font-size:20px;" class="turnblack"> Copyright is extended to websites and although a ‘notice’ is not necessary to ensure the copyright exists, it is advised in order to deter copyrighting. I have provided some information on copyright notices below:
<br><ol style=" font-size:20px;" class="turnblack">
<li> What is a copyright notice? A piece of text which accompanies a work and expresses the rights and wishes of the owner(s).</li>
<li> Do I need a notice? There is no legal requirement to include a copyright notice. Whether a notice is used or not will not change the fact that copyright exists in the work. It is however strongly recommended that you include one on your work if all all possible to deter copyright infringement. The aim of copyright notice is to: </li>
<ul style=" font-size:20px;" class="turnblack">
    <li> Make it clear that the work is subject to copyright.</li>
        <li> Provide a means of identifying the copyright owner.</li>
            <li> Deter infringement or plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p  style="font-size:20px;" class="turnblack">
1. Where should the notice be placed? The rule to adopt is to ensure that anyone with access to your work is aware of the copyright. If your work can be broken up into several pieces, then the notice should appear on each part. If it would normally be viewed as a whole then one will suffice. Include acknowledgements for any images, excerpts etc. that you have used which are not your own, and ensure that you obtain permission before you use anyone else’s work.
<ul style=" font-size:20px;" class="turnblack">
    <li>If you are writing a book, you should only need one inside the front cover.</li>
<li> Leaflets, commercial documents, etc. should have one on each item.</li>
    <li>Web pages should have one on every page.</li>
    <li>In the music industry, one is placed on the CD, cassette or LP itself, and one is included on any accompanying sleeve or booklet.</li>
    <li>Photographs and designs will have one at the bottom or on the reverse of the work</li>
   <li> Manuscripts: A single notice on the front will normally suffice  [1] </li>
</ul>
</p>
</p> <br><br>

            Essentially, this implies the importance of keeping a website original and to avoid emulating other works too deeply, in order to avoid prosecution etc. Other common constraints that web developers need to work around are the GDPR guidelines, which are clearly enforced and are applicable to almost every UK business. In order to work to a high standard of web development it’s vital that a developer can stay aware of all of the factors listed above and other related factors when creating websites.
