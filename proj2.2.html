    Some of the major factors involved in the success of digital projects were outlined in section 1.2 (methods, skills, resources). Conversely, these factors will likely play a major role in the failure of digital projects if handled incorrectly.

    In the previous two days I have managed to create a functioning, multipage website with several stylistic elements. From this I draw the conclusion that the tools I’ve been using have been appropriate. 
    <br> <br><br><br> </p>


<p  style="font-size:30px;" class="turnblack">In detail</p>
  <p  style=" font-size:20px;" class="turnblack"> In section 2.1 I have mentioned the qualities and helpful features of some of these tools: Visual studio code and trello. Google chrome has also been helpful in its ability to display my webpages in real time, its resizing function has also allowed me to envision how the website might look on alternative screens i.e. tablets, phones, smaller monitors etc. Thus allowing me to ensure the proper responsiveness of design elements such as pictures, videos and graphics etc.  <br><br>

    However, I would like to address a significant point on the appropriateness of the tools used.  Collectively these tools have, as mentioned above: enabled me to achieve many of my websites end goals in just a couple of days. However, I believe the creation of a single piece of software that could handle all of the necessary functions: Code writing and editing, text editing, web previewing and project organisation could be a more appropriate and less fiddly tool for the job. If the functions were linked, it could provide certain benefits. For example, the project organisation tool (trello alternative) could update automatically when certain code files had been written and tested, or when a paragraph had been completed on the text editor. <br><br>
    
    I would like to conclude that the tools used have certainly been appropriate and sufficient for the task,  in relation to current tools on the market (that I’m aware of). However, I believe these tools haven’t reached their maximum potential and therefore are not perfectly appropriate for the task at hand.
