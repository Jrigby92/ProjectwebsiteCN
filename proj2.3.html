    Thus far I am happy with the tools I have implemented on the website, however I do plan to add more functionality before completion.

<!-- <p >Theory in action</p> -->
  <p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;"> Up to this point I feel the website is user friendly, well presented and functional enough to act as a portfolio / showcase of my knowledge.  In terms of website navigation I have so far implanted a functional ’sticky’ menu bar tool, along with a functional name/logo in the top left of every page which diverts users back to the about me page. For presentation,  I have  implanted responsive videos, images and graphics to several of the pages. In addition to well formatted text to display my question answers. I have also customised the background colours of each page.  </p>

   <!-- <p> To name but a few..... these uses of IT are mirrored across the world in a wide variety of companies, from international PLC’s to domestic SME’s. There are ever increasing IT based products and services available for businesses to make use of. 
    
    Secondly, I believe the ways in which Tesla uses IT to create opportunities for the world is obvious. For Tesla, it’s rooted in its highly sophisticated product design of electric vehicles. These products will have required various types of IT to create. They also require large amounts and many types of IT to run, in the form of software updates and incremental battery improvements etc. I believe they have created an opportunity for humanity by providing a safe and green alternative to traditional carbon dioxide producing cars. Providing humans with the opportunity to carry on as normal but in a safer and more efficient way.

    <div id="div2"><p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px; "> However, my next goal for the website presentation will be to add more complex backgrounds using ‘flex’. I hope this will add a new dynamic and deepen the already broad aesthetics of the website. I also plan to make the website tablet and phone repsonsive. In regards to enhancing the functionality of the website, I plan to add a functional contact page for clients / employers to contact me through. Although I anticipate that this will require some java script coding and might be time intensive, hopefully I will have enough time to add a functional contact page with an interactive map.</p> </div>
