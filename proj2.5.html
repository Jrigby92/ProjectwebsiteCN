    I am close to finalising my website, currently I am content with my outcomes and believe they are fit for purpose. I have created a structured website with user friendly options for visitors to navigate the website.

  <p  style=" font-size:20px; color: rgb(95, 95, 95);"> I have done this by creating a sticky navigation bar at the bottom of the website which includes navigations to every website page. I have also created an interactive name / logo by nesting it inside of a link tag, when clicked it sends visitors back to the about me page. I believe that the user will certainly be able to navigate between my answers in a quick and efficient way. 
<br><br>
    In terms of stylisation and content presentation, I hope I have made my website aesthetically pleasing enough with content thats easily digestible to the reader. To create a pleasing aesthetic I have employed many methods, by adding colourful sections, titles, graphics, images, videos, text boxes and text in various formats i.e. columns and standard paragraphs. In general, I have separated each of these elements by using div /div tags, this allowed me to stylise each group or div section in a different way, with a different “background-color” or font styles etc. I have used CSS as another way of organising the elements and linked all html files back to the same CSS sheet. This has allowed me to replicate webpages easily, and make slight global adjustments or changes on the master CSS sheet that apply to the whole website, in a very efficient way. When unique element changes are needed, I have either added extra CSS within the html file by  using the style=“” function, inside the first tag of said element. Or as an alternative method, for very intensive unique CSS, I have created classes or ID’s in the master CSS sheet which the unique elements can link back to. I’ve found this helpful, because if for example I need a unique .box class to depict the text alignment of a section I can create this in the master CSS file and then if I need those specific settings again I could easily refer back the .box class I made earlier on any of the pages, because as mentioned; every html page has been linked back to the master css file.
    <br><br>
    All of these methods have helped me create a website which I believe is matches the necessary requirements and is fit for purpose.
