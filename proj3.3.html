    If given the option, in the future I would certainly prefer to carry out projects in teams.

<!-- <p >Theory in action</p> -->
  <p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;"> I believe it improves my own drive and productivity, along with giving a clearer understanding from the beginning of the project of how much time investment is required to complete. This is because each avenue of tasks can be worked on In parallel. And if it’s discovered the writing is taking longer than the web designing for example, the roles of each team member could be shifted to create a balanced timeline for each project goal. Ideally, resulting a unified completion of the goals in the most efficient manor. It’s also clear that for the majority of people working in a team motivates each other to fulfil their own part of the project, since we are all social animals at heart.

   <!-- <p> To name but a few..... these uses of IT are mirrored across the world in a wide variety of companies, from international PLC’s to domestic SME’s. There are ever increasing IT based products and services available for businesses to make use of. 
    
    Secondly, I believe the ways in which Tesla uses IT to create opportunities for the world is obvious. For Tesla, it’s rooted in its highly sophisticated product design of electric vehicles. These products will have required various types of IT to create. They also require large amounts and many types of IT to run, in the form of software updates and incremental battery improvements etc. I believe they have created an opportunity for humanity by providing a safe and green alternative to traditional carbon dioxide producing cars. Providing humans with the opportunity to carry on as normal but in a safer and more efficient way.

    <div id="div2"><p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px; ">  In such a scenario I would certainly employ zoom, slack and trello to keep a team unified and properly in sync with each other. There is much research on how important ‘soft skills’ are to complete projects, and the aforementioned software certainly creates an environment where soft skills can flourish. I would be keen however, to see if zoom would employ all of the features of slack or visa versa. In this case I would be eager to switch platforms to the most comprehensive. 
<br><br>
        If given the same project again, to be completed alone. I would certainly ease my use of the trello board. Along with designing my website in a more efficient way, as explained in unit 3.2.
