   I believe the primary purposes of IT in business is to create new opportunities for humanity and increase business efficiency in order to maximise business results. 

    For these primary purposes to be achieved, IT provides a wide variety of uses I.e. data collection, data processing, artificial intelligence, programming, robotics, enhanced communication, research, virtual storage etc. These uses could also be referred to as secondary purposes of IT. <br>

<!-- <p >Theory in action</p> -->
  <p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;"> To further clarify, I will provide an example of how IT might be used in a real modern day 
    business; If you take a global company such as Tesla, their uses of IT are manyfold and will be implemented in many areas of the business. I will briefly outline 
    the ways in which they use IT to increase business efficiency: </p>
    <ul class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;">
    <li>	using robotics in an automated production line. </li>
    <li>	Automated production systems such as automated stock ordering when car parts supplies are running low. </li>
    <li>	Data collection and processing on customer and sales information, as-well as on social media reactions to new releases etc. All of this aids the business to 
      learn from its actions very efficiently. </li>
    <li>  Targeted ads using big data for an efficient marketing process. </li>
    <li>	The use of the internet, email and other communication platforms such as stack or zoom for efficient communications. </li>
  	<li>	Efficient virtual storage solutions such as cloud based servers or Git for product design. </li>
    <li>	Data collection on product performances and problems to increase product efficiency.</li>
  </ul> 
  <br>
   <!-- <p> To name but a few..... these uses of IT are mirrored across the world in a wide variety of companies, from international PLC’s to domestic SME’s. There are ever increasing IT based products and services available for businesses to make use of. 
    
    Secondly, I believe the ways in which Tesla uses IT to create opportunities for the world is obvious. For Tesla, it’s rooted in its highly sophisticated product design of electric vehicles. These products will have required various types of IT to create. They also require large amounts and many types of IT to run, in the form of software updates and incremental battery improvements etc. I believe they have created an opportunity for humanity by providing a safe and green alternative to traditional carbon dioxide producing cars. Providing humans with the opportunity to carry on as normal but in a safer and more efficient way.
