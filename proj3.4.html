    For my project I utilised several digital solutions in creating the website, for now I will focus on how developing coding techniques offered me solutions to several problems throughout the project.

<!-- <p >Theory in action</p> -->
  <p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px;"> I will focus on my coding for this question, because it’s the digital solution which required the most testing. 
<br><br>
    Being quite new to HTML and CSS, I experimented often with coding techniques and with almost every step and new function / div group etc which I created, I found it was worth testing. Sometimes I discovered changes that I made would have undesirable effects and the testing process helped me learn. I carried out testing by editing code in visual studio editor and then using google chrome to see how those edits affected the final webpage. I also used safari on occasion to double check the website was stable across browsers. In the event that I would find an error, I would go back into studio editor and try using different techniques until I got the code perfect. Sometimes this involved researching new techniques online to find the most appropriate ones, editing the code and testing again. I continued this process throughout the development of the website.

   <!-- <p> To name but a few..... these uses of IT are mirrored across the world in a wide variety of companies, from international PLC’s to domestic SME’s. There are ever increasing IT based products and services available for businesses to make use of. 
    
    Secondly, I believe the ways in which Tesla uses IT to create opportunities for the world is obvious. For Tesla, it’s rooted in its highly sophisticated product design of electric vehicles. These products will have required various types of IT to create. They also require large amounts and many types of IT to run, in the form of software updates and incremental battery improvements etc. I believe they have created an opportunity for humanity by providing a safe and green alternative to traditional carbon dioxide producing cars. Providing humans with the opportunity to carry on as normal but in a safer and more efficient way.

    <div id="div2"><p class="turnblack" style="font-size:20px; "> On one occasion I made 10 or 12 changes without testing, before having to undo all of them and restart that webpage to get things working again, this led me to the conclusion that testing is an absolutely vital step that should be continually carried out throughout the build process. Not only to ensure quality control but also to enhance the learning experience of any project. </p>
